# Curbside Contact

Curbside Contact is a web application allowing business to interact with customers via SMS for the purposes of coordinating services when:


*   a customer is not able to come inside the building (during Covid19, maybe beyond)
*   the business wants an asynchronous way for many customers to be able to attend to this need, without further clogging what might be busy phone lines.

Customers will need to be informed of the phone number dedicated to this system, and educated that it is only for use with curbside communication.  This can be done over the phone in advance of arrival, with signage, etc.


If you are an employee at a business using the Curbside solution, you are likely looking for the [User Guide](userguide.md).

If you are looking to configure the behavior of the application, such as setting statuses, see the [Admin user guide](admin-user.md).

If you are looking to set up an instance of Curbside, or configure new numbers, see the [System Admin guide](admin-system.md)
