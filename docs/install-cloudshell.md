# Curbside install instructions

You should hopefully be reading this inside the Google Cloud project Cloud Shell environment.

If not, please open in Cloud Shell using the button at the end of [admin guide](admin-system.md)

The first step is to open the adjacent editor tab for `env.bash` and plugin the values for your Cloud Project ID, and Twilio credentials from the [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings).

Save this file after those changes, and in the terminal section of the Cloud Shell (usually located in lower portion of this window) run the following:

    bash install.bash

This file has comments that explain each step - if you wish to perform them one by one.

Once the install is complete, additional instructions should open here, otherwise click [this](install-complete.md)
